Under the bright sunshine of the great transformation of the 40th anniversary of reform and opening up, the blockchain field has gradually penetrated into all walks of life and exerted its \"credit value\" function. Looking back at the 2017 chain and the currency circle, there is no doubt that \"a big Yangxian can change the belief\", \"as long as you buy and hold, you can lie down and make money\" hot market, but the tide will eventually recede, the economic market No one can guarantee that compared with the chain and the currency circle, it is necessary to effectively reflect the value of the team, accelerate the integration with the real economy, and cooperate with the common promotion of policies, technologies and markets to optimize the traditional industrial model and help the high quality. development of. As a public chain based on DAG technology, Vite proposes a forward-looking point of view of joint governance, and publicly selects high-quality talents with ability, condition, responsibility and ideal blockchain. As the candidate for Vite nodes, the following three points are bit dimensions. Community development planning:",
          "The first, It is imperative. In the context of the Internet, where the demographic dividend is gradually fading, and the once-popular but eclipsed sharing economy, the blockchain focuses on assisting the transformation and upgrading of the industry. When the bit dimension succeeds as one of the Vite nodes, our team or community will follow. The official pace of Vite, in conjunction with the official completion of the node's responsibilities, participate in the Vite node co-construction and optimization steps. The Vite node is only one part of the community construction. The members of the Bit Dimensional team have doubled computer science and technology and financial economics, are proficient in various computer development languages, have more than five years of experience in the financial industry, and coincide with the blockchain field. Solid technical skills and rich experience in the development and operation of blockchain projects have made our bit dimension team more confident to be able to work on Vite nodes. At the same time, there are also Vite and Loopring positions among team members, which is a solid guideline protocol. Advocates and enthusiasts;",
          "Second, Take a multi-pronged approach. Community and ecological construction need both hard and soft. On the one hand, the bit-dimensional team with experience in node selection has a complete set of server resources, provides a series of technical support, and arranges real-time monitoring of nodes to ensure stable operation of the system; In the process of promoting Vite's ecological construction, the Bit Dimensional team currently has thousands of communities and mature ecological promotion and organization experience, and effectively uses the bit dimension public number, bit dimension financial website and other self-media channels and consulting communities. The technical community co-catalyzes, effectively promotes Vite, knows Vite in a popular way, understands Vite in depth, and enthusiastically joins Vite. Anyone who contributes to the bit-dimensional node, whether it is community construction or technical maintenance, will be 20% of the proceeds are incentives and 5% are outstanding contributions. And the Bit Dimensional team will also combine their own project comprehension, share technical documentation, answer and guide the Vite technology community. At the same time, the bit dimension has the experience of Dapp landing application development, and has developed distributed applications based on the underlying technology of eos and sidechain fibos. Currently, it has a deep understanding and familiarity with Vite related technical documents for the later application of ecological construction. get ready;",
          "Third, Be prepared for the rain. The Bit Dimensional Team firmly believes that in the context of the new era, the new journey, and the new mission, the blockchain revolution must be able to subvert the traditional, complex, over-centered, and inefficient system, serving more transparent and efficient And fair areas. Therefore, the bit-dimensional team is not only committed to node construction, but will use a more precise angle and more abundant power to make a combination of community construction and application development. In the future, the bit dimension team will implement “four more”. : Put forward more Vite project ideas, issue more applications, recruit more investment institutions, and recruit more people of insight.",

              "answer": [
                  "Vite 最大的创新点是引入了异步的设置：",
                  "第一，我们把智能合约的调用做了异步的拆分。Nano（DAG三驾马车之一）的项目，它把一笔转账分为出账和入账两个动作。我们借鉴了Nano，把它扩展到转账及智能合约的调用上，把一笔转账交易拆分为出账和入账，把一个合约调用交易拆分为合约的请求交易和合约的响应交易两部分。",
                  "第二个是写入和确认的一个异步的设计。在Vite中，一个交易被写入账本和一个交易被确认是异步的。传统的区块链（如比特币），交易写入账本的速度会受到打包速度的制约。而在Vite中，用户可以在TPS限额之内写入很多交易到账本，但交易是以匀速异步确认的，这样可以削平波峰波谷，最大化地利用系统的资源，提高整个系统的吞吐量。同时，两个账户之间的交易不会彼此堵塞，不会出现因为某一个账户发送了大量交易，使其他账户的交易长期得不到确认。",
                  "第三个是合约间调用的异步设计。以太坊里的合约间调用是通过消息调用，或者叫内部交易的方式来完成的，这组调用要么同时完成，要么全部失败，这是一个原子性的ACID语义，会成为性能瓶颈。我们借鉴了一些中心化互联网技术中比较成熟的方案，采用了消息驱动的架构，合约之间不共享任何状态，只通过彼此发送消息来进行通信。"
