        <p>&nbsp;</p>         <h2><span style="color: rgb(51,51,51);">I</span>、Information you need to submit</h2><p>1.Name and logo of your node. These two items are necessary, as they help establish your image in the community. </p><p>2.Email address of your project that operates the SBP. </p><p>3.Election slogan for your node. </p><p>4.Information of your team.  A list of key members and their background info. Their photos and locations. </p><p>5.Setup of your data center. (Recommended: 8 core, 16GB RAM, 100Mbps)</p><p>6.Location of your server. </p><p>7.Plan for the Vite ecosystem. Please describe in detail how you plan to add value to the Vite ecosystem after becoming a SBP. </p><p>8.Social media exposure. Significant exposure on social media reflects your level of commitment. </p><p><br />Link for submitting your information: <a href="https://jiandaoyun.com/f/5bdbef8be1613237783c264b">https://jiandaoyun.com/f/5bdbef8be1613237783c264b</a></p><h2><br /><span style="color: rgb(51,51,51);">Ⅱ、</span>Registration of SBP and Voting</h2><p class="p1">You must follow the below steps to register super nodes and prepare for election:</p><p class="p1"><br /></p><p class="p3">1<span class="s2">、</span>Migration of VITE tokens</p><p class="p3">In mid-November, migrate your Vite tokens on ERC20 to VITE on the TestNet via a smart contract provided by Vite Labs. </p><p class="p1"><span class="s1">2</span>、Stake 500,000 VITE (this amount will change to 1,000,000 VITE after MainNet is launched). This amount of tokens will be locked for three months as part of the requirements for SBPs.  </p><p class="p1"><span class="s1">3</span>、Receive at least 200,000 votes (each represented by one VITE). As TestNet first goes live, Vite Labs will be responsible for operating 25 super nodes that forge tokens (“forging super nodes”). As each new community super node appears and receives at least 200,000 votes, Vite Labs will retire a super node from its side. The said community super node will become a new forging super node. </p><p class="p1"><span class="s1">4</span>、Running the server for a SBP (more detailed setup information will be released later)</p><p class="p2"><br /></p><p class="p1">【Voting】</p><p class="p1"><span>1、Each VITE can only be used to vote for one SBP. </span></p><p class="p1">2、Each address can only be used for voting for one SBP. The number of votes from that address will be the entire amount of VITE held in that address. </p><p class="p1">3、Voting from a given address does not lock up VITE tokens from that address. The tokens may be transferred away at any time, thereby reducing the same amount of votes for a certain node. </p><p class="p2">4、The user may change his voting target. The change will take effect within at most 75 seconds. </p><h2 class="p2"><span style="color: rgb(51,51,51);">III、</span>Responsibilities of SBPs（三、责任）</h2><p class="p2">1、SBPs ensure the proper functioning <span>of the Vite system. SBPs must pack transactions in the entire network and ensure stability of the system by providing usable server resources. In addition, operators of the SBPs are also expected to provide technical support for the Vite system to the best of their abilities. </span></p><p class="p2">2、SBPs are representatives, evangelists, and leaders of the Vite community and are expected to take actions to build and preserve an active and healthy community. </p><p class="p2">3、The prosperity of the Vite community goes hand in hand with the success of the Vite ecosystem. SBPs are expected to evangelize for Vite, and help create dApps based on Vite. </p><h2><br /><span style="color: rgb(51,51,51);">IV、</span>Incentive Plan（四、激励方案）</h2><p class="p1"><span>1、All forging SBPs will share forging rewards, equivalent to 3% of the total issued token amount on an annual basis. This translates to 30 million VITE (3% of the current 1 billion VITE). </span></p><p class="p1">2、一个挖矿超级节点如果持续挖矿1年，可以获得120万（3000万/25）的VITE的奖励，折算成1天可得3287.67个VITE，一个月可得10万个VITE。</p><p class="p1">3、测试网络阶段奖励为市场推广和空投的奖励，主网上线会通过增发进行超级节点奖励。</p><p class="p1">4、超级节点奖励按照出块计算，每个块计算一次奖励。</p><p class="p1">5、<span>奖励提取，只能提取30分钟以前的出块奖励。</span></p><p class="p1"><br /></p><p class="p1">Rewards are requested by users. Only rewards from block production of (???at least???) 30 minutes ago may be provided upon request. </p><h2><span style="color: rgb(51,51,51);">V、</span>An explanation of the VITE token in TestNet</h2><p class="p1">1、在测试网络中，用户竞选超级节点和投票的VITE，来自于ERC20 VITE代币的1:1映射，需要用户把ERC20 VITE代币转换到Vite测试网络。</p><p class="p1">2、转换是不可逆的，代币转换后，短期内将无法在二级市场流通。</p><p class="p1">3、待主网上线后，测试网络的VITE和ERC20的VITE代币统一会映射到Vite主网。</p><p class="p1">After MainNet is launched, VITE tokens on the TestNet and VITE tokens on ERC20 will both be converted on to the MainNet. </p>
